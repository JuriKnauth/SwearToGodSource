Title		Swear to God
Version		1.1

Tagline		Skip around a magical keyboard echoing cuss words.

Description	As a tigress thrown onto a magical keyboard, 
		you'll have to sidestep traps and keep cute creatures at bay. 
		The keys echo the uttered curses of the gods. 
		Their words bring doom or blessing. It is crucial to study the 
		layout of the keyboard and sense which letters flare up next.

Key Features:	Master different keyboard layouts.
			Choose from a variety of different supported keyboards.
				Note that the layout of your system keyboard must match the 
				selected keyboard in the game settings. Install additional 
				keyboards if you want to try out new ones!​
		Learn kid-friendly cusswords from various languages.
			Add your cherished bad words and share them with the community.
		What goes around comes around.
			As one shouts into the forest, so it echoes out. 
			Even cursing in the woods, where there is no one around to hear it, 
			can set things into motion that cannot be undone.
